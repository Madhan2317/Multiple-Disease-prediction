# 🧠 IntelliHealth: Multi-Disease Prediction System

## 🔬 Project Overview

**IntelliHealth** is a powerful and interactive machine learning web application built with **Streamlit** that helps predict the presence of three critical diseases:

- 🩸 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
- 🧬 Liver Disease
- 🗣️ Parkinson’s Disease

The system uses pre-trained **Random Forest** models and allows users to input relevant medical data to determine whether the patient might have the selected disease. It offers an intuitive, single-page interface with dynamic input fields based on disease selection and provides instant predictions with a clean UI/UX experience.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Select between **three different disease models** from a dropdown menu  
✅ Dynamically display relevant input fields for each disease  
✅ Predict in real-time using trained Random Forest models  
✅ No sidebar – **All content neatly displayed on one page**  
✅ **Custom background image** and styled elements for professional look  
✅ Inline prediction results with visual indicators (✅ / ❎)  
✅ Responsive layout with columns for better organization
